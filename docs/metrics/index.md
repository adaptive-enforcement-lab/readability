# Understanding Metrics

This tool measures how easy your writing is to read. Here's what each score means.

## The Key Numbers

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Grade Level** | School grade needed to understand |
| **Reading Ease** | Comfort level (0-100, higher = easier) |
| **ARI** | Another grade measure, based on characters |
| **Fog Index** | Years of schooling needed |

!!! tip "Quick Rule"
    For most docs, aim for grade 10-14 and ease above 30.

## What's a Good Score?

| Your Audience | Target Grade | Target Ease |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Everyone | 6-8 | 60-70 |
| High schoolers | 9-12 | 50-60 |
| Tech workers | 12-14 | 30-50 |
| Experts only | 14+ | Under 30 |

## How to Improve

Bad scores usually mean:

- Sentences are too long
- Words have too many syllables
- Writing is passive instead of active

**Fix it by:**

1. Break long sentences into shorter ones
2. Use simple words (say "use" not "utilize")
3. Write "the API returns data" not "data is returned"
